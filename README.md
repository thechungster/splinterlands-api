## Card

### Base card

A base card url which has no stats can be requested as follows

- `getCardImageBaseById(cardId, /* optional */ isGold, /* optional */ edition)`

If isGold is not specified, the card will be standard foil. If edition is not specified, the image returned will be the latest edition. For Example `getCardImageBaseById(/* cardId */ 13)` would return

![Base Image](https://d36mxiodymuqjm.cloudfront.net/cards_beta/Spineback%20Turtle.png)

To request the gold foil alpha version

- `getCardImageBaseById(cardId, /* isGold */ true, /* edition */ 0)`

A detailed card url which includes stats at each level can be requested as such

- `getCardImageLevelById(cardId, level, /* optional */ isGold, /* optional */ edition)`
